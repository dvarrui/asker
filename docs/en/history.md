##The problem

Working as a teacher, one of the most boring taks is check the same exercises
again and again, for every student, and every year.

The tests questions allow as to make activities that are automaticaly checked/resolved by
software tools (For example: Moodle cuestionairs). In this case
the teacher has enough time to waste on:
* Analise the results.
* Read information about others materials.
* Test new aplications.
* Develop new tools.
* Etc.

In resume, apply that knowledge to improve his work, to try new ways of
doing his job better, to find or redefined the activities or lessons contents,
just to find a better way of teaching. And an easier way of learning for the students.

## The Tool

I decide to write this tool that help me with the process of
making test questions from input definition files.

I only waste time making this input file, but as a teacher I have this
into my mind. It's the resume or concept map of the unit I'm teaching.

I've been using this tools several years/courses, teaching computer
science. I have a lot of work to improve it and new features to add.
It's usefull (for me at least), and hope It'll be for you too.

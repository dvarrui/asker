#History

As a teacher, one of the most boring taks is check the same exercises
again and again, for every student, and every year. The test questions
allow as to create activities that are automaticaly checked/resolved by 
software application (For example: Moodle cuestionairs). In this case
the teacher has time to waste on analising the results or whatever you need.
And apply that knowledge to improve his work, to try new ways of doing his job, to
find or redefined the activities or lessons contents, just to find
a better way of teaching. And an easier way of learning for the students.

The big problem with test questions are that only are usefull to evaluate
measurable features. So it could be very limited if we want measure abstract
features. But we could do this with other view. I mean.

If I get an open and abstract problem, their resolution will have several
steps or measurable milestones. So we could transform an open problem, 
into a close one. And I have to focus on measure this aspects.

Besides, if I "bomb" the student with a huge amount of diferent questions
about one concept, probably I could be near of knowing and measuring, the
student asimilation of this concepts.

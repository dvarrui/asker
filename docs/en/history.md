##The problem

Working as a teacher, one of the most boring taks is check the same exercises
again and again, for every student, and every year.

The tests questions allow as to make activities that are automaticaly checked/resolved by 
software tools (For example: Moodle cuestionairs). In this case
the teacher has enough time to waste on:
* Analise the results.
* Read information about others materials.
* Test new aplications.
* Develop new tools.
* Etc.

In resume, apply that knowledge to improve his work, to try new ways of 
doing his job better, to find or redefined the activities or lessons contents, 
just to find a better way of teaching. And an easier way of learning for the students.

## Open vs closed problems

The big problem with test questions are that only are usefull to evaluate
measurable features. So it could be very limited if we want measure abstract
features or open problems. But we could do this with other point of view.

I mean, if I get an open and abstract problem, their resolution will have 
several steps or measurable milestones. So we could transform an open problem, 
into a lot of closed mini-problems. And I have to focus on measure this aspects.

Besides, if I *"bomb"* the student with a huge amount of diferent questions
about one concept, probably I could be near of knowing and measuring, the
student asimilation of this concepts.

## Making Questions

Creating test questions to solve the previous problem, becames another 
different problem to solve. When I make manually this test questions, it
took me a lot of time. And I need a lot of them.

And when I'm making the question number 31, I realise that I forgot the
content of the 30 previous. I'm loosing time and I'm slow.

## The Tool

Finally, I decide to write this tool that help me with the process of
making test questions from input definition files.

I only waste time making this input file, but as a teacher I have this
into my mind. It's the resume or concept map of the unit I'm teaching.

I've been using this tools several years/courses, teaching computer
science. I have a lot of work to improve it and new features to add.
It's usefull (for me at least), and hope It'll be for you too.

# Learn basics

To know how to build our asker input files, we need to learn
theses keywords:
* map, concept, names, tags, def
* table, row and col

Let's start.

---

# Text plain editor

* Create a text file, called for example: `demo/furniture.haml`.
* **map**: Once, at first line, we write keyword `map`. Example:

```ruby
%map{ :lang => 'en', :context => 'furniture, home', :version => '1'}
```

| Attribute | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| lang      | Output texts will be created in English        |
| context   | Comma separated labels that define map content |
| version   | Input file format version |

This input file will contain concepts about furniture context.

* **concept, names, tags**: So we define our first concept:

```
  %concept
    %names chair
    %tags single, seat, leg, backrest
```

| Param | Description                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------- |
| names | Comma separated concept's names |
| tags  | Comma separated tags that help to identify this concept |

* **def**: Use def keyword to add concept meaning. The `def` content must uniquely identifies our concept. You can use `def` more than once.

```
  %concept
    %names chair
    %tags single, seat, leg, backrest
    %def Single seat with legs and backrest
    %def Furniture that is placed around the table to sit
```

At this time, we may generate questions with:

```bash
asker demo/furniture.haml
```

---

# Formats

HAML is a special format. It's necesary write exactly:
* 0 spaces before map.
* 2 spaces before concept.
* 4 spaces before names, tags and def.

It's posible write the same using XML format instead. Take a look:

```xml
<map lang='en' context='furniture, home' version='1'>
  <concept>
    <names>chair</names>
    <tags>single, seat, leg, backrest</tags>
    <def>Single seat with legs and backrest</def>
    <def>Furniture that is placed around the table to sit</def>
  </concept>
</map>
```

Notice that `demo/furniture.haml` is HAML file and  `demo/furniture.xml` a XML file. Both are valid.

> HAML format files are the same as XML format files.
Internaly HAML files are translated automaticaly to an XML equivalent.
>
> Why write into HAML instead of XML? HAML It's easier (for me).
You don't have to close every tag, only be carefuly with indentation.
>
> If you prefer, you could write your input files using XML.

# Adding images

Example:
![](https://www.portobellostreet.es/imagenes_muebles/Muebles-Silla-colonial-Fusta-Bora-Bora.jpg)

**def** can be used with image URL. So we have to find an image that uniquely identifies our concept and write this:

```
    %def{:type => 'image_url'}https://www.portobellostreet.es/imagenes_muebles/Muebles-Silla-colonial-Fusta-Bora-Bora.jpg
```

| Attribute | Description  |
| --------- | ------------ |
| type      | Content type |

---

# Increase questions number

Adding more concepts will increase questions number generated by ASKER:

```
  %concept
    %names couch
    %tags furniture, seat, two, threee, people, bench, armrest

  %concept
    %names table
    %tags furniture, flat, top, leg, surface, work, eat

  %concept
    %names bed
    %tags furniture, place, sleep, relax
```

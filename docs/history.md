## The problem

Working as a teacher, one of the most boring taks is check the same exercises
again and again, for every student, and every year.

The tests questions allow us to make activities that are automaticaly checked/resolved by software tools, as for example, Moodle cuestionairs.
In this case, the teacher will have enough time to waste others tasks, as:
* Analise results with detail.
* Read information about others materials.
* Test new aplications.
* Develop new tools.
* Etc.

In resume, applying more new knowledge to improve his work,
trying new ways of doing his job better, finding or redefining activities or lessons contents. Just finding a better way of teaching. And an easier way of learning for the students.

## Need a new tool

I decide (about 2013) start writing this tool to help me
with the process of making test questions from input definition files.

With this tool, I only waste time making this input file.
As a teacher I have this knowledge into my mind, so it will be easy.
It's the resume, definitions or conceptual entities of the unit
I'm teaching.

I've been using this tools several years/courses, teaching computer
science. I have a lot of work to improve it and new features to add.
It's usefull (for me at least), and hope It'll be for you too.
